/**
 * Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) utility class.
 * The FFT algorithm transforms a time-domain audio signal (waveform)
 * into a frequency-domain signal (spectrum).
 * This is useful when you want to analyze which frequencies are present in the sound.
 * Important:
 * - If you only want to display the waveform, you don't need FFT.
 * - If you want to display the frequency spectrum, you must use FFT.
